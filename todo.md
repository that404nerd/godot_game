## FSM based Movement System:

- Sideways movement when falling [x]
- Down gravity for normal jumps [x]

- Add 3 points to the jump arc (Jump, Peak, Landing like a parabola) []
- Jump buffer []
- Air dash fix []
- Fix a bug where jumping during the falling state doesn't trigger the falling state after the jump []
- Tracking previous states (Base-states/Sub-States) [] (FUTURE....)
